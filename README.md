# Single Process Web Server Scheduling Simulation 

19SPWZ_CPS_4410_W02_SYSTEMS_SIMULATION

## Introduction

This is a Jave implementation of the single process web server with high flexiablity. The interarrival times are independent and identically distributed (IID) exponential random variables with a user-inputed mean. The file sizes for requests are IID Pareto random variables with Pareto index Î± = 1.2 and x<sub>min</sub> = 3KB. The server process can deliever 30KB/second. This implementation also allows the choices between scheduling policies [First-In-First-Out (FIFO) & Short-Job-First (SJF)] and request number The following part is the outputs with different parameters. After plenty of attempts, I found **1,000,000,000** is an ideal value for ***number of trails*** to generate a relatively accurate and stable result. Thus, for setup[A-D] below, ***number of request*** is set to **10,000**, and ***number of trails*** is set to **1,000,000,000**. Since the trails number is huge, a progress bar is added to indicate the overall progress. Besides, in order to verify the result, a seed (123456) is assigned for setup[E-H] to generate a same list of random number 

## Data Collection
